# Taktology

A minimal, modular interchange vocabulary for **takt / Lean construction production
planning** — the kind of plan you build as a coloured grid of *wagons* flowing
through *takt zones* over time.

It models the **process** half of takt planning (takt tasks, wagons, trains, crews,
takt time) as a thin layer on top of the [TopologicPy ontology](https://wassimj.github.io/topologicpy/ontology/topologicpy.ttl)
(`top:`), which supplies the **spatial** half (zones, elements, geometry, graph) and
already aligns to both [BOT](https://w3id.org/bot#) and IFC. Takt terms are aligned
to IFC process concepts (`IfcTask`, `IfcRelSequence`, …) by `skos:closeMatch`
annotation — **not** by importing the heavy ifcOWL schema.

> Origin: this repo is the synthesis of a research conversation working from the
> BIMTakt paper (Becker & Tschickardt, 2023) toward an interoperable,
> manufacturer-neutral model. See [docs/](docs/) for the full reasoning.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`ontology/takt.ttl`](ontology/takt.ttl) | **The vocabulary** (T-Box). ~24 terms: 6 classes, 8 object properties, 10 datatype properties. |
| [`examples/lumi-b5-1.ttl`](examples/lumi-b5-1.ttl) | A worked **A-Box** — wagon 5.2 in zone B5:1 from a real takt plan, exercising every term, with duration computed end-to-end. |
| [`schema/takt-topology-schema.yaml`](schema/takt-topology-schema.yaml) | Node + edge definitions for a **property-graph build** (Neo4j / NetworkX / rdflib), plus the generation loop. |
| [`scripts/takt_production_ingester_plan.md`](scripts/takt_production_ingester_plan.md) | Implementation plan for an **IFC + wagon-table → takt graph** ingester. |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | Architecture, vocabulary, design decisions (ADRs), and BIMTakt background. |
| [`research/`](research/) | **Research corpus** — 37 verified sources grounding the design ([INDEX](research/INDEX.md), [manifest](research/manifest.json), per-source notes, [ADR-001](research/decisions/ADR-001-research-grounding.md)). |

## The core idea in one picture

```
  WagonType ──instantiates── TaktTask ──performedIn── TaktZone ──containsElement── Element
   (rate,                      │  │                     (top:                        (top:
    crew)                      │  └──actsOn──────────────────────────────────────────►│
                               │     operand subset → drives duration                 area/
                  hasSuccessor │                                                      volume)
                               ▼
                            TaktTask   (next wagon → the train = a top:Path)
```

A **wagon** is a trade's work package; its per-zone occurrences are **takt tasks**;
the ordered chain of tasks is the **train**; the **takt zone** is the work area they
flow through. One graph traversal runs from a task to the geometry that drives its
duration (`task → actsOn → element → area`) — which a spreadsheet cannot do.

## Design stance (the short version)

- **Author only the gap.** `top:` already provides zones, elements, geometry, graph,
  and the BOT+IFC alignments. This repo adds *only* the process layer `top:` lacks.
- **`closeMatch`, not import.** IFC is the semantic anchor via annotation; ifcOWL's
  ~14k axioms are never imported. Round-tripping to `.ifc` is a converter's job.
- **You haven't left IFC.** You keep IFC's process model as the reference; you only
  choose whether the `.ifc` file is your transport format. Format ≠ semantics.
- **`actsOn` ≠ `performedIn`.** A task's *operand* (the elements it builds/operates
  on) is a distinct, direct link — separate from the *location* (the zone). The
  duration formula reads the operand, not the zone total.

Full rationale in [docs/03-decisions.md](docs/03-decisions.md).

## Research grounding

The design is evidence-based, not vibes. [`research/`](research/) is a curated corpus
of **37 verified sources** across takt theory, location-based planning, takt+BIM
automation, IFC/ontologies, and implementation case studies — each tracing to a
decision via [ADR-001](research/decisions/ADR-001-research-grounding.md). The corpus's
headline finding: **no takt-specific ontology exists** in the literature (taktology
fills the gap), and geometry-driven takt zoning has little prior art (a build risk,
flagged honestly in [the gaps section](research/INDEX.md#gaps-where-taktology-designs-with-thin-evidence--most-valuable-section)).

## Validating the ontology

No network was available when these files were authored, so they were syntax-checked
structurally, **not** parsed by a real RDF engine. Before relying on them:

```bash
# Apache Jena
riot --validate ontology/takt.ttl examples/lumi-b5-1.ttl
# or load both in Protégé and run a reasoner for a consistency check
```

## Open items before publishing

- **Namespace.** `https://w3id.org/taktology#` is the *intended* permanent
  namespace; the w3id.org redirect must be registered first. Until then it is a
  placeholder and does not resolve.
- **`top:` namespace URI.** Verify the exact TopologicPy ontology namespace against
  the published `.ttl` before relying on `top:FunctionalZone` / `top:Element` /
  `top:Path` / `top:area`.
- **License.** Not yet chosen — see note below.
- **Train Reading A vs B.** The vocabulary encodes Reading A (cross-trade convoy).
  Confirm with the team; it changes where every sequence edge goes.
